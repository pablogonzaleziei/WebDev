    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>I have been responsible for designing and developing electronic systems embedded in various medical simulator
        manikins. These systems are used to train students in different procedures such as endotracheal intubation and
        CPR.</p>

    <p>My key responsibilities in this role have included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Design and develop prototypes, test methods, and system instructions.</li>
        <li>Incorporating real-time feedback with BLE and WiFi pre-certified modules, designing based on Nordic chipset
            (nRF52xxx) and Espressif modules</li>
        <li>Implementing OTA/FOTA of Nordic and Espressif chipset</li>
        <li>Designing power supply and control PCBs in collaboration with design engineers to embed the electronic
            system</li>
        <li>Collaborating with software teams to develop an app for both Android and iOS platforms</li>
        <li>Defining and implementing communication protocols such as I2C and SPI</li>
        <li>Send live video streaming of the procedure via WIFI to the app.</li>
        <li>Project management. Market research, development, contact stakeholders (manufacturers, suppliers), train
            production, testing, and QC.</li>
        <li>Manage the budget and create BOMs and alternative designs based on stock.</li>
        <li>Preparing demo prototypes and incorporating feedback to refine and improve designs while maintaining budget
            and adhering to good manufacturing practices</li>
        <li>Designing cable harnesses with a focus on user experience and production necessities</li>
        <li>Defining project specifications and finding the best sensor solution for each project, such as IMUs,
            pressure sensors, image sensors, optic sensors, and more.</li>
    </ul>
